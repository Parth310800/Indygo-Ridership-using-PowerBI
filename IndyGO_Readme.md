# IndyGo Ridership Analytics Dashboard using Power BI

## Project Overview

This project presents a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard developed to analyze and visualize ridership data for the IndyGo transit system. Created in collaboration with IndyGo and the IU Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, this business intelligence tool transforms raw ridership data into actionable insights. 

The primary objective is to empower a diverse group of stakeholders—from transit planners and policymakers to the general public—with a data-driven platform for strategic decision-making, operational optimization, and enhanced public engagement.

## Dashboard Framework & Methodology

Our approach follows a structured BI framework, ensuring that the final product is robust, scalable, and aligned with stakeholder needs. [cite\_start]The process moves from data ingestion and analysis to interactive visualization and strategic deployment. 

1.  **Stakeholder Analysis:** The initial phase involved identifying key stakeholders and their unique data requirements, ensuring the dashboard delivers targeted value. 
2.  **Data Analysis & Processing:** We processed comprehensive ridership data, focusing on trends across various routes, timeframes, and service categories (e.g., weekday vs. weekend).
3.  **Visualization & Interpretation:** The processed data was modeled into an interactive dashboard featuring KPI cards, dynamic filters, and multiple chart types to facilitate intuitive data exploration. 
4.  **Deployment & Strategic Implementation:** The deployed dashboard serves as a strategic tool for enhancing public engagement and informing high-level decision-making at IndyGo.

## Stakeholder-Centric Design

The dashboard is tailored to meet the specific needs of various user groups:

  * **For IndyGo Transit Planners:** Provides access to granular ridership trends, peak travel times, and route performance metrics to optimize service planning. 
  * **For the Public and Commuters:** Offers user-friendly visualizations that simplify travel planning and help passengers make informed decisions. 
  * **For Researchers and Data Analysts:** Delivers access to well-structured data for advanced analytics and predictive modeling. [cite: 16, 17]
  * **For Government and Policymakers:** Presents high-level trend reports to inform infrastructure and policy decisions. [cite: 18, 19]
  * **For Technology Developers:** Features structured datasets ready for API integration to enhance third-party transit applications. [cite: 20, 21]

## Technical Deep Dive: Dashboard Components

The dashboard is composed of several interactive components that allow for multi-dimensional data analysis.

 
#### 1\. Global Filters

A unified filter pane at the top allows for dynamic data segmentation. [cite\_start]All visuals and KPIs update instantly based on user selections. [cite: 25, 26, 31]

  * **Year Selector:** Toggle between 2022, 2023, and 2024.
  * **Month Dropdown:** Isolate data for a specific month. 
  * **Route Number Selector:** Focus analysis on a single bus route. 
  * **Day Type Filter:** Refine data by Weekday or Weekend service. 

#### 2\. Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Cards

At-a-glance metrics provide a high-level summary of performance for the filtered period. 

  * **Route Name:** Dynamically displays the human-readable name of the selected route. 
  * **Total Ridership:** An aggregate sum of all passenger boardings and alightings. 
  * **Average Ridership:** The total ridership divided by the number of unique service days. 

#### 3\. Advanced Visualizations

A suite of interactive charts enables deep exploration of ridership patterns.

  * **Donut Chart (Ridership by Day of the Week):** Visualizes the distribution of ridership across the week, with segments labeled by raw counts and percentages. 
  * **Line Chart (Daily Boarding & Alighting Trend):** Plots daily passenger counts for the selected month, allowing for the identification of trends and anomalies. 
  * **Horizontal Bar Chart (Stop-Level Ridership):** Ranks the top bus stops by passenger boardings and alightings, helping to identify high-traffic locations and potential bottlenecks. 

## Strategic Impact & Actionable Insights

This dashboard is more than a visualization tool; it is a strategic asset that enables data-driven action.

  * **Peak Ridership Analysis:** By comparing ridership density between weekdays and weekends, the dashboard provides the data needed to optimize schedules and increase service frequency during peak demand. 
  * **Rapid Route Prioritization:** The tool helps identify which rapid transit routes have the most consistent and highest ridership, justifying further investment in Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) infrastructure. 
  * **Agile Service Planning:** The dynamic and filterable nature of the visualizations allows planners to use real-time insights for agile adjustments to service and routes.
