# IndyGo Ridership Analytics Dashboard using Power BI

## Project Overview

This project presents a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard developed to analyze and visualize ridership data for the IndyGo transit system. [cite\_start]Created in collaboration with IndyGo and the IU Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, this business intelligence tool transforms raw ridership data into actionable insights. [cite: 3]

[cite\_start]The primary objective is to empower a diverse group of stakeholders—from transit planners and policymakers to the general public—with a data-driven platform for strategic decision-making, operational optimization, and enhanced public engagement. [cite: 12, 15, 17, 19, 21]

## Dashboard Framework & Methodology

Our approach follows a structured BI framework, ensuring that the final product is robust, scalable, and aligned with stakeholder needs. [cite\_start]The process moves from data ingestion and analysis to interactive visualization and strategic deployment. [cite: 9]

1.  [cite\_start]**Stakeholder Analysis:** The initial phase involved identifying key stakeholders and their unique data requirements, ensuring the dashboard delivers targeted value. [cite: 9, 11]
2.  [cite\_start]**Data Analysis & Processing:** We processed comprehensive ridership data, focusing on trends across various routes, timeframes, and service categories (e.g., weekday vs. weekend). [cite: 9]
3.  [cite\_start]**Visualization & Interpretation:** The processed data was modeled into an interactive dashboard featuring KPI cards, dynamic filters, and multiple chart types to facilitate intuitive data exploration. [cite: 9]
4.  [cite\_start]**Deployment & Strategic Implementation:** The deployed dashboard serves as a strategic tool for enhancing public engagement and informing high-level decision-making at IndyGo. [cite: 9]

## Stakeholder-Centric Design

The dashboard is tailored to meet the specific needs of various user groups:

  * [cite\_start]**For IndyGo Transit Planners:** Provides access to granular ridership trends, peak travel times, and route performance metrics to optimize service planning. [cite: 12, 13]
  * [cite\_start]**For the Public and Commuters:** Offers user-friendly visualizations that simplify travel planning and help passengers make informed decisions. [cite: 14, 15]
  * [cite\_start]**For Researchers and Data Analysts:** Delivers access to well-structured data for advanced analytics and predictive modeling. [cite: 16, 17]
  * [cite\_start]**For Government and Policymakers:** Presents high-level trend reports to inform infrastructure and policy decisions. [cite: 18, 19]
  * [cite\_start]**For Technology Developers:** Features structured datasets ready for API integration to enhance third-party transit applications. [cite: 20, 21]

## Technical Deep Dive: Dashboard Components

The dashboard is composed of several interactive components that allow for multi-dimensional data analysis.

 *(Self-hosted image of the dashboard overview)*

#### 1\. Global Filters

A unified filter pane at the top allows for dynamic data segmentation. [cite\_start]All visuals and KPIs update instantly based on user selections. [cite: 25, 26, 31]

  * [cite\_start]**Year Selector:** Toggle between 2022, 2023, and 2024. [cite: 27]
  * [cite\_start]**Month Dropdown:** Isolate data for a specific month. [cite: 28]
  * [cite\_start]**Route Number Selector:** Focus analysis on a single bus route. [cite: 29]
  * [cite\_start]**Day Type Filter:** Refine data by Weekday or Weekend service. [cite: 30]

#### 2\. Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Cards

[cite\_start]At-a-glance metrics provide a high-level summary of performance for the filtered period. [cite: 32]

  * [cite\_start]**Route Name:** Dynamically displays the human-readable name of the selected route. [cite: 33]
  * [cite\_start]**Total Ridership:** An aggregate sum of all passenger boardings and alightings. [cite: 34]
  * [cite\_start]**Average Ridership:** The total ridership divided by the number of unique service days. [cite: 35]

#### 3\. Advanced Visualizations

A suite of interactive charts enables deep exploration of ridership patterns.

  * [cite\_start]**Donut Chart (Ridership by Day of the Week):** Visualizes the distribution of ridership across the week, with segments labeled by raw counts and percentages. [cite: 38]
  * [cite\_start]**Line Chart (Daily Boarding & Alighting Trend):** Plots daily passenger counts for the selected month, allowing for the identification of trends and anomalies. [cite: 38]
  * [cite\_start]**Horizontal Bar Chart (Stop-Level Ridership):** Ranks the top bus stops by passenger boardings and alightings, helping to identify high-traffic locations and potential bottlenecks. [cite: 38]

## Strategic Impact & Actionable Insights

This dashboard is more than a visualization tool; it is a strategic asset that enables data-driven action.

  * [cite\_start]**Peak Ridership Analysis:** By comparing ridership density between weekdays and weekends, the dashboard provides the data needed to optimize schedules and increase service frequency during peak demand. [cite: 40, 41, 42, 43]
  * [cite\_start]**Rapid Route Prioritization:** The tool helps identify which rapid transit routes have the most consistent and highest ridership, justifying further investment in Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) infrastructure. [cite: 44, 45, 46]
  * [cite\_start]**Agile Service Planning:** The dynamic and filterable nature of the visualizations allows planners to use real-time insights for agile adjustments to service and routes. [cite: 50, 51, 52]
